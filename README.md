# Kali Vagrant VM
Automation for my Kali setup. I got tired of having to do this all the damn time, so instead I automated everything through Vagrant.

## Usage

1. Make sure Vagrant is installed
2. Install the vb-guest plugin with `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`
3. Download this repo to the VirtualBox VMs folder or wherever
4. Confirm settings in `Vagrantfile.`
5. `vagrant up`
6. `vagrant ssh`
7. `sudo passwd mttaggart`
8. `su mttaggart`
9. `./final.sh`

Enjoy!
